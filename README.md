# 5 Day Weather
  

## Description

![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue )

In this project I have developed a Front End application that uses third party apis to allow the user to get a 5 day weather forecast for 
any location by entering it into the search bar. Viewing the weather is vital for a plethora of reasons, so having an easy, unbloated way to 
get weather conditions is awesome. This project was a good way to familiarize myself with the process of integrating third party apis into a 
project to increase their functionality and skimming thru the data from the apis efficiently.
